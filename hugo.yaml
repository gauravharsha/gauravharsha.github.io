      Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor

      My research focuses on electronic structure theory, many-body methods, and open-source software for quantum materials.
      I am particularly interested in materials where thermal effects, disorder, and relativity
      play a crucial role in determining their properties.

      I am one of the core developers for the [GREEN](https://green-phys.org) software package,
      where I lead implementations of new methods, optimize performance for modern HPC
      architectures, and train new users in its application.

    content: |-
      I am a computational physicist working on the development of electronic-structure and many-body
      methods for quantum materials.
      My research focuses on wave-function and Green’s-function approaches, tailored to capture
      thermal, disorder and relativistic effects.
      I place a strong emphasis on open-source, high-performance software, and currently work as 
      the core-developer for [GREEN](https://green-phys.org) software ecosystem, implementing methods that
      bridge first-principles theory with predictive materials modeling.
